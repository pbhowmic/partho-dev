Welcome to Django is a beast
============================

This blog is not a paean to Django. Django is powerful and also prone to being misused, mostly due to it's size.
Much as I love Django as a framework, I must admit that the sheer size of it - it is a very capable web framework -
means almost no one knows about everything that Django has to offer, where it shines or falls short. Fortunately, the
Django project itself is has great documentation so this blog is not trying to regurgitate or recycle that
documentation but instead aims to do a deep dive into aspects of Django.
